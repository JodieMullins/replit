# Replit's 100 Days of Python Challenge

Here are the snippets of code I created while completing Replit's 100 days of Python. 

Day one starts with basic print statements, and the journey grows progressively harder. 

To remind myself that progress is not merely a checklist, I have titled each document by its corresponding day of code. However, I have tried to give an idea of the code snippet given it's Commit message at this time.

As I build this repository, my plan is to provide a clear index using descriptions here in the ReadMe file for easier navigation of the repo.
